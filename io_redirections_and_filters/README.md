# Shell, I/O redirections_and_filters

## 📄 Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on understanding and manipulating file redirection, special characters, and other man pages in a Linux/Unix environment.

### Learning Objectives
*I/O Redirection: Manipulating the flow of data using standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).

*Command Pipelines: Using the pipe operator (|) to send the output of one program into the input of another, creating powerful command chains.

*Filters and Text Processing: Mastering core utilities like grep, sort, uniq, tr, and cut to parse and transform text data.

*Special Characters: Understanding the behavior of shell expansions, quoting (single vs. double), and escapes (backslash).

*System Files: Familiarization with the structure of critical system files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
